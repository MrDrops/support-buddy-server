# Support Buddy Server
React Back-end team project

## Description
Back-end for the Support Buddy App. App to help people with motivation problems characteristic of depression or other mental health problems to mantain basic routines and avoid derailing their lives while they get better. The idea is to give structure and routine in areas such as physical activity, work and hobbies/recreation so that the person using the app doesn't fall behind in their lives due to the loss of motivation and initiative that is generally caused by mental health issues. The app gives agency to the user by giving choice of action, but keeps them acountable to themselves in a friendly manner to avoid the negative loop of commiting to do something and failing to do it. It offers alternatives, queries on activity enjoyment, reinforces success and offers a space to journal and reflect on your own behaviour.

## Motivation
As an group assignment for General Assembly, the team had all a background in mental health or related fields and or experience, so we focused on what we could do to contribute to this population, and this idea was born. Most focus on more obvious issues if mental health, but the lack of motivation and overall anhedonia that makes any activity difficult to perform is hard to approach. What's worse, a continual neglect of basic life components such as physical activity, work life or hobbies further deteriorates physical and mental health, making recovery even harder. The idea of this app is to help people suffering from these problems push themselves into action.

## Build Status
The backend for the Support Budy is ready to deploy. It needs more activities and other data to populate the database and make the app useful.
